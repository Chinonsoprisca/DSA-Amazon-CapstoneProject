### Project Overview

In this project, I am tasked with analysing products and customer review data to generate insights that will guide product improvements, marketing strategy and customer engagement. 

### Data Source

  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Visualization
     


### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
This involves identifying data errors and then changing, updating or removing data to correct them.
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Verifying blank cells
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
  1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
  2. How many products are listed under each category?
  3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
  4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
  5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
  6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
  7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
  8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
  9. What is the total potential revenue (actuallprice x rating count) by category?
  10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <T200, T200-*500, >E500)?
  11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
  12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?

### Finding and Recommendation
- Three products Electronics had the highest sales product.
- West had lowest sales total.
- Shoes had the highest sales in both sales year and Socks had lowest sales.
- February is the most productive year in both sales year.

- More goods should be supplied to the South since it generates more revenue, this will help to increase sales turnover, more branches can also be established in the South.
- Different brands of shoes should be supplied to all regions, because customers seem to purchase more of it, and their purchasing interest should be sustained with multi-brand choice.
- I suggest that more investigation should be carried out on the West store to know the cause of its low sales.
- it could be that people don't wear Socks much, which causes the sales to be low. If the revenue is not more than the capital, I suggest it should be removed from the stores.**
