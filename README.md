  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Visualization
     


### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
This involves identifying data errors and then changing, updating or removing data to correct them.
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Verifying blank cells
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

  1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
  2. How many products are listed under each category?
  3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
  4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
  5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
  6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
  7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
  8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
  9. What is the total potential revenue (actuallprice x rating count) by category?
  10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <T200, T200-*500, >E500)?
  11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
  12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
  13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
  14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

### Finding and Recommendation
- Three product category(Electonics, computers/Accessories and Home/Kitchen) have very high rating count and occurrence compared to others.
- Electronics had the highest sales product and rating count.
- HomeImprovement has the highest average discount percentage with just two products.
- More products (1139) have reviews greater than 1000. Only 326 products have reviews less than 1000
- Greater number (889) of products have discount price above 500.
- More discounts does not automatically increase sales or review.



- The discount rate should be reviewed and reduced where neccerary since it higher discounts does not really increase review rate or sales.
